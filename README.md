The project consists of three pages:
1. Taking 2 tables from the database through the Django Model. This 2 tables are linked each other by a primary and a secondary key. The second table appears when you click on the button. 
2. A table with data from Binance and Bybit, taken via the API using the requests library. The data is updated without reloading the page using JavaScript ajax. 
3. Bootstrap-form for adding data to the database. The data is sent to the server via a post-request. Checking whether the user entered the correct date.
